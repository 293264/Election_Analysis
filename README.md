#Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
I strongly advise that the election commission save this script to be utilized for futuer elections. The script has accurately calculated the voter turnout, percentage of votes for each county, the county with the highest turnout and, of course, it was able determine the winning candidate of the congressional election. If need be, modifications can be made to the script. 
For example, if the commision wishes to add a particutar county to the county listed it could use the append function, i.e >>>>>>counties.append('El Paso"). On the hand if it decided to remove a county it could us the remove function, i.e >>>>counties.remove("Denver"). All in all saving this script will allow for effeicient calculations of ballots submitted, voter turnout, and county data amond other things.
