# Election_Analysis
Finding out voting information for each county using Python

#Purpose of the election audit

The purpose of this project is to find out which county is the largest based off of votes. In module 3 we learned how to read csv files in python and begin to run the data with our coding skills. The data file has 4 columns, we had to search through the one that had all of the candidates and figure out how many votes each candidate recieved. Once we figure out the total votes and percentage of the total that they had we wrote the results to a text file with a winner. In the module 3 challenge we are doing something similar but different. This time we will search through the counties column to figure out the total votes and percentage of each county to find which county is the largest.
